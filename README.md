# ChromeTabDeduper
A Chome extension for deduplicating tabs

## Why Another of these?
Yes, this kind of extension already exists for Chrome. However, after using Firefox for some time,
I found the [Duplicate Tab Closer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duplicate-tabs-closer/)
plugin and realised how disatisfied I was with the existing Chrome extensions, and was going to have a hard time migrating
back if I was forced to use the existing options.

Things I wanted to solve with Tab Deduper:
- Allow manual closing of dupped tabs, rather than forcing automatic
- Allowing more complex control over what is considered a duplicate (with RegExps, etc)
